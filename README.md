The **Signer** class is designed for those who are signing data on behalf of a public-private keypair.

In principle, the "client party" has public key (i.e., `client_id`) and a matching private key (i.e., `client_secret`) that can be verified by both the signer and the client (but nobody else as we don't want to make forgeries possible).

The "signing party" has a simple identifier which acts as an additional piece of entropy in the algorithm, and can help differentiate between multiple signing parties if the client party does something like try to use the same public-private keypair independently of a signing party (as is common with GPG signing).

Based on a simplified version of the AWS Signature v4.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) for managing backwards-compatibility.

## Examples

(Using [word_wrap()](https://gist.github.com/js-coder/3581285) for line wrapping.)

```ruby
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'

signer = WePay::Signer.new(client_id, client_secret);
signature = signer.sign({
  :token        => your_token,
  :page         => wepay_page_to_visit,
  :redirect_uri => partner_page_to_return_to,
})

puts signature.word_wrap(64)
#=> dfbffab5b6f7156402da8147886bba3eba67bd5baf2e780ba9d39e8437db7c47
#=> 35e9a0b834aa21ac76f98da8c52a2a0cd1b0192d0f0df5c98e3848b1b2e1a037

querystring = signer.generate_query_string_params({
  :token        => your_token,
  :page         => wepay_page_to_visit,
  :redirect_uri => partner_page_to_return_to,
})

#=> client_id=your_client_id&
#=> page=https://wepay.com/account/12345&
#=> redirect_uri=https://partnersite.com/home&
#=> token=dfbffab5b6f7156402da8147886bba3eba67bd5baf2e780ba9d39e8437db7c47...
